# System Programming Examples

These are the examples from the book of Lilyan Nikolov "System programming",
TU-Sofia, 2000. They were typed and corrected by me in the spring of 2001 and
initially tested on [RedHat Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux)
6.2, [Slackware Linux](http://www.slackware.com/) 8.0 and 8.1. All examples in
C++ were translated in C, because no C++ feature was actually used.

## Requirements

As the examples are updated regularly a recent C compiler, `make` tool and C
library are necessary to build them successfully. The examples are sure to
build successfully with the following:

* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 11.2.0;
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 4.3; and
* [GNU C library](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) 2.33.

Please, report any problems building the examples with these or other tools
or versions.
