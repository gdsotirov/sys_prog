# System Programming Examples

These are the examples from the book of Lilyan Nikolov "System programming",
TU-Sofia, 2000. They were typed and corrected by me in the spring of 2001 and
tested on [RedHat Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux) 6.2,
[Slackware Linux](http://www.slackware.com/) 8.0 and 8.1. All examples in C++
were translated in C, because I did not see the need for using C++.

## Requirements

A recent C compiler (e.g. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)), `make` (e.g.
[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)) and C library (e.g.
[GNU C](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)) are necessary to build the
examples.
