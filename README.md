   These are the examples from the book of Lilyan Nikolov "System programming",
TU-Sofia, 2000.  They were typed are corrected by me in the spring of 2001 and
tested on RedHat Linux 6.2, Slackware Linux 8.0 and 8.1.  All examples in C++
were translated in C, bacause I don't see the need for using C++.
